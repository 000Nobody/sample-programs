# Sample Programs in Every Language

Welcome to the Sample Programs in Every Language repository! What began
as a simple 100 Days of Code challenge has expanded into a fun project.
Within this repository, you'll find a growing collection of simple programs
in just about every programming language to date.

## Learn More About Every Language

For every program in this repository, I've written a corresponding article
breaking it down. If that sounds interesting, feel free to leverage the links
in the README files spread throughout the repository.

## Contribute to Every Language

Currently, the only programs in this repository are Hello World programs.
Of course, the goal of this project is to provide a variety of code snippets
for as many languages as possible.

If you wish to contribute, simply fork the repo and make a pull request
with your changes. Your contribution should ideally be in one of two forms:

1. An additional language(s) for an existing sample program (i.e. Hello World)
2. An additional sample program for an existing language(s) (i.e. Perl)

The following list contains all existing sample programs:

1. [Hello World](https://therenegadecoder.com/code/hello-world-in-every-language/)

If you create a sample program that is not in this list, please provide the
solution for at least *five* languages to kickstart development.

Otherwise, let's have some fun!
