# Sample Programs in Every Language

Welcome to the
[Sample Programs in Every Language](https://therenegadecoder.com/code/sample-programs-in-every-language/)
repository! What began
as a simple
[100 Days of Code](http://www.100daysofcode.com/)
challenge has expanded into a fun project.
Within this repository, you'll find a growing collection of simple programs
in just about every programming language to date.

## Learn More

For every program in this repository, I've written a corresponding article
breaking it down. If that sounds interesting, feel free to leverage the links
in the README files spread throughout the repository.

In addition, you can find links to the sample program collections below
in the contribute section.

## Contribute

To properly follow GitHub community rules, I've moved the contribution
instructions to [it's own document](https://github.com/jrg94/sample-programs/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md).
