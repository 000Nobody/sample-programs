# Sample Programs in Every Language

Welcome to the [Sample Programs in Every Language][0] repository! What began
as a simple [100 Days of Code][1] challenge has expanded into a fun project.
Within this repository, you'll find a growing collection of simple programs
in just about every programming language to date.

## Learn More

Originally, I had planned to have an article written for every code snippet in this repository. 
However, in the interest of growing this collection, I removed the pull request merge article requirement.
As a result, not every code snippet in the repository has an associated article, yet.

Of course, I'm adding articles every day, and I'm tracking my article progress under the issues tab.
Feel free to request your favorites from there, and I'll try to move them up the queue.

At any rate, if articles sound interesting, here are a few to get you started:

- [Sample Programs in Every Language][0]
- [Hello World in Every Language][2]
- [Reverse a String in Every Language][3]
- [The Coolest Programming Language Features][4]

Alternatively, feel free to leverage the links in the README files spread throughout the repository. 
In addition, we have a rather extensive [wiki][5] which includes a table row for every language 
in the repository. For each language, you'll find information like open issues and contributors.

## Contribute

To properly follow the recommended GitHub community standards, I've created [contribution
instructions][6]. Please refer to this document before contributing to this repository.

As an added note, I try to write articles for all the contributions. If you're interesting in helping out with
that, [register for an account][7] on The Renegade Coder. When you're done, let me know, so I can elevate your privileges. 
I'm always excited to have support from guest authors.
