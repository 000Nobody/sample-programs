# Sample Programs in Every Language

Welcome to the
[Sample Programs in Every Language](https://therenegadecoder.com/code/sample-programs-in-every-language/)
repository! What began
as a simple
[100 Days of Code](http://www.100daysofcode.com/)
challenge has expanded into a fun project.
Within this repository, you'll find a growing collection of simple programs
in just about every programming language to date.

## Learn More

Originally, I had planned to have an article written for every code snippet in this repository. 
However, in the interest of growing this collection, I removed the pull request merge article requirement.
As a result, not every code snippet in the repository has an associated article, yet.

Of course, I'm adding articles every day, and I'm tracking my article progress under the issues tab.
Feel free to request your favorites from there, and I'll try to move them up the queue.

At any rate, if articles sound interesting, feel free to leverage the links
in the README files spread throughout the repository.

Alternatively, you can browse all current projects from the [Sample Programs
in Every Language](https://therenegadecoder.com/code/sample-programs-in-every-language/)
article.
