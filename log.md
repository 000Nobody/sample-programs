# 100 Days Of Code - Log

Welcome to my 100 Days of Code log. If you haven't heard, I've challenged myself
to explore 100 different languages over the next 100 days. In fact, not only
do I plan to implement Hello World in 100 languages, but I also plan to learn
about each language's background and history. See you at the end!

In addition to this list, [I'm tracking my progress on my blog](https://therenegadecoder.com/code/hello-world-in-every-language/).
